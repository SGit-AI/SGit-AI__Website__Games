// The pre-release gate. Run from anywhere: node admin/build/validate.js
//
// Four checks are the house gate, inherited from pki.sgit.ai, graphs.sgit.ai and
// wardley-maps.sgit.ai unchanged in intent:
//   1. version agreement — admin/build/version.txt vs every page's badge, the versions
//      table, llms.txt and every .md twin
//   2. internal links — every relative href/src resolves to a file in the tree
//   3. canonical host — every canonical and og:url is on the host in CNAME
//   4. key-leak tripwire — nothing in the tree may look like an sgit vault key
//
// Three are specific to these two sites, and each exists because of something this
// family has already got wrong once:
//   5. an embed page carries its disclosure — the games phone home, and a page that
//      mounts one without saying so is the exact defect sgit.ai published as finding 1
//      against the vault ("nothing sent" on the same screen as events being sent)
//   6. maturity labels come from the ladder — a card cannot invent a status
//   7. the read key is the one we meant to publish — see check 4's note
//
// Any failure exits 1: no tag, no publish.

//     in the games family actually uses (4evnlwrj, kqngdecz, …)
// The second shape is the one that matters here and the one the inherited check missed.
// It is also the shape of a VAULT key, `<passphrase>:<vault-id>` — bearer read AND write,
// with no revocation list. A read key is 64 hex and is publishable on purpose; a vault key
// is not publishable ever, and the two are one character class apart to a careless eye.
//

// pattern: a pattern that admits our read key admits every credential of that shape, which
// is how the check would come to pass while meaning nothing.
